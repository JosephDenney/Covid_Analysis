Notes:
1. separate out some of the pieces of the the workflow, specifically in Cust_Func
2. imagining 3 functions for those long pieces of code, with 1 combining those 3 functions in order to get a single clean graphed forecasted output
3. PLOT portion outside of the giant long function wherever possible
4. take in a SARIMA forecast of ICU/Ventilator into the SARIMAX function in order to better predict deaths! modulize that function
5. how are we handling which states to pick. like south dakota. 
6. small section of what of these other variables is the best indicator of future deaths. state by state positivity rates
7. what sort of recommendations are we going for? bigger pictures, other factors as exogenous data? what is the most helpful in predicting deaths ? 

8. right now deaths is running total, in icu currently is the current value. utility slash usefulness are slightly different, currently indicates pressure on the healthcare system

9. Feed in a ventilator forecast into the exogenous SARIMAX functions to improve the modeling while adding sophistication. make this and return this in a separate function.
